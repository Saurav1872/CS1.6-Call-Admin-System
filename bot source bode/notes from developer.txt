Extra info from developers desk ( only howler sitting atm xD )

1. Bot uses these permission 
	`Send messages, read messages, read messages history, embed links, manage messages, use extral emojies, add reaction, and use slash commands`
	
	But, if bot is hosted by someone trusted, or by owner, its better to give it administrator permission.
	
2. Bot commands can be used only by guild (discord sv) administrator and the one who have roles from differents bot positions.
	These positions are:
	=> Admin
	=> Moderator
	=> Administrator
	
	Check add, remove and get commands info to get more info related to managing these positions.

3. To get bot prefix, mention the bot in the chat, like this @botname .
4. If the bot is added for the first time, use >setup command to setup the bot.
5. The default bot prefix is `>` , if any command didnot works even if you bares the rank, check the bot prefix by mentioning the bot via @botname
6. The bot runs on nodejs server, these node packages are required before running the bot:
		"discord.js": "^13.0.1",
		"dotenv": "^10.0.0",
		"ms": "^2.1.3"
7. The bot needs identify, applications.commands and bot scopes to run. Make sure the bot haves it or it may crash.
8. If any commands related to calladmin ( ex: close, open, resetreport , changestatus etc ) , then use command `>fakereport` to create a fakereport and use those commands on this fake report. This will make it easy to trace if the issue is server side or the bot side.
9. Make sure the bot have access to the channel where the report is sent. Else, it will give an error.
