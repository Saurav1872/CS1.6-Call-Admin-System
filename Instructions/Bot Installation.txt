Discord bot:
	1) Go to 'https://discord.com/developers/applications' and log in.
	2) Click on 'New Application' which you can see in the upper right corner and choose the name of the desired application and create it.
	3) Once you are in your application area, click on the 'Bot' button which you can see in the left corner in the center.
	4) Click on 'Add Bot" and then 'Yes, do it!'.
	5) Copy and save the bot token, we need it for calladmin plugins.
	6) Once the bot is created, disable the 'Public bot' option (so you can only use it) and enable "REQUIRES OAUTH2 CODE GRANT" and add it to the discord servers.
	7) Click OAuth2, then click 'Add redirect' and add any website, it is better if you add "https://ugc-gaming.net/index.php". Nothing but unlocking the Outh2 feature. There is nothing related to redirection at all, only that, without redirection, we cannot use other features.
	8) Copy and save the client's secret for future uses.
	9) Now in OAuth2, go to the "URL Generator" tab.
	10) Select the redirect URL we created earlier in the SELECT REDIRECT URL.
	11) Choose 'bot', 'identify' and 'applications.commands' from the 'scopes' section, and give the bot basic permissions that any normal member can have. ( Send messages, read messages, read messages history, embed links, manage messages, mention everyone, use extral emojies, add reaction, and use slash commands).
	12) Copy and paste the generated URL into your browser and choose the server on which you want to install the bot.
	13) Ensure that the bot can send messages to the channel you want to receive CallAdmin reports on.
